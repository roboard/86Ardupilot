This ported Ardupilot is version 3.6 dev. (2017.09.15)
The Ardupilot flight stack is modified to run on DuinOS?(FreeDOS)

### Requirements
1. a DuinOS SD card (http://www.86duino.com/index.php?p=11878)
2. 9-axis IMU, Barometers (Recommend GY-91 sensor module)
3. 6 channel RC Transmitter/Receiver
4. GPS module (optional)

### Supported hardware
* GY-86 sensor module (I2C, MPU6050, MS5611, HMC5883L)
* GY-91 sensor module (SPI, MPU9250 [pin.9], BMP280 [pin.8])
* VL53L0X range finder (I2C)
* Ublox-M8N GPS module (UART)
* 6-CH RC receiver(PWM)

### (Windows) Build ArduPilot for 86duino
Only ArduCopter had been tested on 86duino One.

1. Download the toolchain (url)
2. Run Ardupilot.bat (for setup environment)
3. Navigate to the ArduCopter source code folder (eg. C:\86ardupilot\ArduCopter\)
4. run "make 86duino ¡Vj4"

First time installation:
Copy ArduCopter.exe (in ArduCopter folder) into the SD card, then rename it to _86duino.exe (replace the original one).
	
Upload firmware by usb connection(for developer):
1. Run Ardupilot.bat
2. Navigate to the Tools folder (eg. C:\86ardupilot\Tools\)
3. run "upx ..\..\ArduCopter\ArduCopter.exe"
4. run "v86dude com'N' 20 ..\..\ArduCopter\ArduCopter.exe standalone" ('N' is the usb comport number)

### Setup Ardupilot
Same as other ardupilot flight controller, please refer the official tutorial
http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/configuring-hardware.html

### Known Issues
1. Currently the system is running in single thread, thus the SD card R/W may cause the drone crash. Strongly recommend disable the Log function.(set LOG_BACKEND_TYPE to none)
